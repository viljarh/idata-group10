## Design guidelines

Through the project we have followed a set of components, and used a global.css file.

The Global.css file was made in the start of the project, and this made us have the same theme for the whole project, where we have used this to style the components and text we are implementing. 

We havent followed the classic guidelines template, but have tried to have it simple and elegant.

Specific Techincal decisions

We used components and icons from Shadcn and Lucide to keep the design the same through the project. We also used a global css file to also maintain the same and easy adjust if wanted.
