# Sprints

## Sprint 1

Get familiar with the project. Understand the requirements and learn the technologies that we are using.

We have created wireframes, use-case diagram and database schema. We started working on the front-end with some skeleton code in Next.js, which is the framework we are going to use.

## Sprint 2

Sprint details :
    Mandag 29. januar - Torsdag 22. Februar
	
Goals:
    wireframe of the pages, 
    HTML skeleton of the project, 
    database sketch, 
    use-case diagram.

Tasks:
    Make wireframes for the project : Viljar , Thomas
    Basic html skeleton of the project, started with typescript and react website, and used a little html: Viljar
    database sketch, basic  structure of the database (tables) : Thomas
    Use case diagrams : Thomas

Feedback : 
    Wireframes need to be continued on, was good  work from both sides but some things were not finished. Need to chose a color pallette. Make some changed about nav bar and the login pages. 
    Website was good, still just the basic, but was a good start.
    database sketch, got some good feedback about what we could change, and make us understand  better how it should look like.
    Use case diagram was just a simple start, but needed to make it more complex and use arrows for what the different types of users could do.

    We had different task since we are two person group, but we are working at the school, but we try to help each other and talk about each other task to get each others opinions. This to ensure that we agree on what and how we should do the project.


## Sprint 3

Sprint details :
    Mandag 26. Februar - Torsdag 21. Mars
	
Goals: 
    Static site with design in place; sketch of responsive site versions

Tasks:
    Continued working on the feedback from checkpoint 2. 
    Worked more on the wireframes to change it after the feedback. : Thomas
    Need to make mobile sketches.
    Database needed to changed the one to many connections, and change some tables to make it simpler at start. Remove user or customer table : Thomas
    Start making the static site, continued from the html sketches and make it more responsive with typescript etc. : Viljar

    Viljar had more controll over the coding part on this checkpoint, while Thomas had more to fix the changes from the feedback on checkpoint 2. 

Done :
    Database is close to done with how it should look, we scaled it down, and have sketches for an more advanced database if we need it for future.
    Wireframes is good, just some small adjustment needed, and correcting the color after colorpallette.


Next step:
    Continue working on backend and frontend. Implement the backend so we can retrieve information to the frontend. Finish the backend before working too much on the frontend, just so we could connect they to eachother.

    Just continue to help eachother, and work together. Both is working on the frontned and backend, wokring together on the school, through liveshare(vscode extension). Try to solve the problems on each other computers before analysing eachother work.
